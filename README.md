# Predicting-Iris-Species-using-Machine-Learning
The goal of this project is to build a classification model that can predict the species of an Iris flower. We'll use the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of Iris: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
